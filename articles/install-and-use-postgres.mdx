## Installing PostgreSQL

#### Ubuntu
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

#### Debian
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.4 postgresql-client-9.4
```

#### MacOs
```sh
brew install postgresql
```

Note: You can also use [homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux) in linux.

## Setup roles

By default, Postgres uses a concept called "roles" to aid in authentication and authorization. So we need to create a role with
the same usernameof your machine:

To know what username you have, you need to run this command:
```sh
whoami
```

Now, you need to access to console of postgresql:
```sh
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Then it's necessary create a role, and database with the same username and give permissions:
```sh
postgres=# create user my_user with encrypted password 'my_pass';
postgres=# create database my_user;
postgres=# grant all privileges on database my_user to my_user;
postgres=# alter user my_user with superuser;
```
Note: if you username has spaces, you need to use `quotation marks` like this: `"Tony Ojeda"`

So it's evething is fine, you could access to the postgres console with this:
```sh
psql
```

## Use postgres

Postgres has some wrappers, two of them are `createdb` and `dropdb`.

With `createdb` you can create a database without necesarry to access to `psql` console,
```sh
createdb gatito_db
```

The same thing happens with `dropdb`, it's allow to delete a database.
```sh
dropdb gatito_db
```

Here are a few commands that can help you day to day:

| Command    | Description |
| -----------| ------------|
`\\l`        | List databases
`\\dt`       | List tables
`\\d`        | List available tables, views, and sequences in current database.
`\\c`        | Connect to a different database. Follow this by the database name.
`\\du`       | List available roles
`\\password` | Change the password for the username that follows.
`\\conninfo` | Get information about the current database and connection.
`\\q`        | Quit the psql program and exit to the Linux prompt.
`\\?:`       | Get a full list of psql commands
`\\h`        | Get help on SQL commands

Note: I love the `\q` command :3

## Common problems with postgres

There are a some known issues with postgres. In my case, I have dealt with one in specific:

> Error: psql: could not connect to server: Connection refused Is the server running on host "127.0.0.1" and accepting TCP/IP connections on port 5432?

You need to list the ports related to postgres:
```sh
sudo netstat -plunt | grep postgres
```

If you see the port the postgres is different to `5.4.3.2`, you need to edit `postgresql.conf` file:
```sh
sudo nano /usr/local/var/postgres/postgresql.conf
```
And change the `port` to `5.4.3.2`

You can see more errors [here](https://www.revsys.com/writings/postgresql/errors.html#cannot-connect-local).


## Conclusion

You should now have a postgres installed in your computer, if you have a issue with postgres you cand send a issue to this repo :)
