There are a lot of questions from the beginners about how is the correct way to works with react and rails,
specifically how to render the react components in rails views and how to pass the data to the components.

In this post I am going to show you some interesting ways to attack this problem:

I assume you are using [webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/docs/integrations.md#react) with react in your rails project

Imagine we have this `Book` component, which is a charge to render a collection of books:

```js
# app/javascript/components/Books.js

function Books({ books }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {books.map((book) => (
        <li key={book.id}>{book.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

And you have a rails view:

```erb
# app/views/home/index.html.erb

<% content_for :javascript do %>
  <%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag "book-home" %>
<% end %>

<%= content_tag(
  :div,
  nil,
  id: "book-list",
  data: { books: @books }
)%>
```

Interesting code right, we need to look more close.

```
<% content_for :javascript do %>
  <%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag "book-home" %>
<% end %>
```

This piece of code, tell to rails that we want to import the `book-home` pack, we don't import the component
directly.

If you are wondering why uses `javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag` helper and not `javascript_pack_tag`,
the answers is we are using the webpack 4 or a newest version, with this webpack creates
html tags for pack and all the dependent chunks, you could react more [here](https://github.com/rails/webpacker#usage)

```
<%= content_tag(
  :div,
  nil,
  id: "book-list",
  data: { books: @books }
)%>
```
In this code we are using data attributes to save server data

Then we need to create a `book` pack:

```
app/javascript/packs/book.js

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import Books from "../components/Books";

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  const $bookNode = document.querySelector("#book-list");
  const books = JSON.parse($app.dataset.books)

  if ($bookNode) {
    ReactDOM.render(<Books books={books} />, $bookNode);
  }
});
```

As you note, we parse the books collection, then we get the props from data attributes, after that
we ensure that div with `book-list` id exist, and finally we render the component and pass the props
to the Book component.

This way is cool, but in the long term we will repeat this process in all future packs, so we can
avoid this creating this nice utility:

```
# app/javascript/lib/mountComponent.js

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

const defaultParser = (dataset) =>
  Object.entries(dataset).reduce((props, [currentKey, currentValue]) => {
    try {
      props[currentKey] = JSON.parse(currentValue);
    } catch (error) {
      props[currentKey] = currentValue;
    }
    return props;
  }, {});

const mountComponent = (
  selector,
  Component,
  mapDataToProps = defaultParser
) => {
  const mount = (element) => {
    const props = mapDataToProps(element.dataset);
    ReactDOM.render(<Component {...props} />, element);
  };

  document.querySelectorAll(selector).forEach(mount);
};

export default mountComponent;
```

So with this, we can update our current `book` pack like this:
```
# app/javascript/packs/book.js

import Books from "../components/Books";
import mountComponent from "../lib/mountComponent";

const $bookNode = document.querySelector("#book-list");
mountComponent($bookNode, Books)
```

What happens if your props have a different name to data-attributes, you
can pass your own customize function to get the props:
```
import Books from "../components/Books";
import mountComponent from "../lib/mountComponent";

const $bookNode = document.querySelector("#book-list");
mountComponent($bookNode, Books, (data) => ({
  initialBooks: data.books,
}))
```

I know there are others ways to improve this like using third packages or work with json scripts(future post),
but in my opinion this is really simple approach since you don't have extra work and you know a deep
how this works.
