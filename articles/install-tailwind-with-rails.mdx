# How to install tailwind with rails

Tailwind is the most popular css framework so far, so in this post I am going to show
you how to install with the most popular, powerful and majestic web framework, yeah I am
talking of `Ruby on Rails`.

1. Add the tailwind package

```
yarn add tailwindcss
```

2. Create a stylesheet and pack

First we need to create stylesheet, and import tailwind:

```
# app/assets/stylesheets/tailwind.scss


@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";

// You can add your own custom components/styles here

@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```

Then we need to create a tailwind pack and import the stylesheet that we created above:

```
# app/javascript/packs/tailwind.js


import "stylesheets/tailwind.scss";
```

3. Setup postcss and webpacker

We need to add the tailwind plugin to our postcss.config.js:

```
# postcss.config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('postcss-import'),
    require("tailwindcss"),
    require('postcss-flexbugs-fixes'),
    require('postcss-preset-env')({
      autoprefixer: {
    ...
```

And then add the tailwind stylesheet to webpacker in the `resolved_paths` option:

```
# config/webpacker.yml

resolved_paths: ['app/assets', 'app/assets/stylesheets']
```

5. Create a tailwind configuration file

We can do this running this command:

```
yarn tailwind init
```

If you want to install all tailwind configuration, you can use the `full` flag:

```
yarn tailwind init --full
```

6. Import tailwind to rails

This is the last step, we need to import the pack and stylesheet into rails

```
# app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
...

<%= javascript_packs_with_chunks_tag "tailwind" %>
<%= stylesheet_pack_tag "tailwind" %>

...
```

And to check everything works fine, we could try to add this html to some view:

```
<div
  class="bg-green-400 font-sans h-screen grid place-content-center text-white"
>
  <h1 class="text-2xl text-center mb-4">Home#index</h1>
  <p>Find me in app/views/home/index.html.erb</p>
</div>
```

And should see this way:

## Important notes

1. Install problems

If you have problems installing the tailwind 2.0 version, specifically you see this error:

```
Error: PostCSS plugin tailwindcss requires PostCSS 8.
```

You could fix that, remove the tailwind package and installing these packages:

```
yarn remove tailwindcss
yarn add  tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat @tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9
```

You can read [more here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#post-css-7-compatibility-build)

2. Improve the spacing size

If you want to extend the range of sizes of the width, height, margins, paddings and all relating to spacing in tailwind,
you could add this nice piece of code to the tailwind configuration:

```
const colors = require("tailwindcss/colors");

const MAX_SPACING_NUMBER = 128;
const numberToSpacing = (number) => ({ [`${number}`]: `${number * 0.25}rem` });
const spacingSizes = Array.from({ length: MAX_SPACING_NUMBER }).reduce(
  (acc, _, index) => ({ ...acc, ...numberToSpacing(index) }),
  {}
);

# add spacingSizes object to the spacing property
module.exports = {
...
  theme: {
    spacing: {
      px: "1px",
      ...spacingSizes,
    },
...
```

And with this we are not limited to the max spacing `w-16`, now you can use `w-17` or `h-100`, if you want
more spacing, you can change the maxSpacingNumber constant.

## Conclusion

This is a really simple way to work tailwind and rails, I really enjoy this framework, the most part
of the time I feel productive, so don't forget to have a initial design or pick some nice template to increment
your speed when you build new applications.
